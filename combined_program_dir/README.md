### Running the program

1. Set the desired sweep (in the MATLAB script) from the array of raw data sweeps. Ignore the plots as these are for the previously stored result.
2. Run the MATLAB script to generate a textfile containing correctly padded and combined hexadecimal IQ samples
3. Run the Python script to send raw data to FPGA and receive the result
4. Run the MATLAB script again and view the resulting plots.
